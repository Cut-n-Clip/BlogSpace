   Turn on Smart Radius and increase the radius to soften out the edges For additional adjustment you can use features like Shift Edge and Decontaminate colors to get the perfect results

d) Once your subject has been selected **bring a background** of your choice and **drag that background layer below the subject layer**.

e) Then head up to **Filter> Blur> Gaussian Blur** 
and add gaussian blur to bring focus on your subject in the foreground.

### **Now you are done with extraction in Adobe Photoshop in less than one minute with a greater efficiency and accuracy.**


### **Method 2** :- Extract your subject from its background in Photoshop using the Select Subject Option.
